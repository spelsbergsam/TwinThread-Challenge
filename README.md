To get this tool started simply download the files ``run_me.py`` and ``df_work.py`` and have them in the same folder. Using python3 run ``run_me.py`` and follow the on screen prompts. 

Currently only tools 1, 2, and 3 work but 4 was not able to be completed within the time constraint. 

The required dependecy for this project is pandas. This can be installed by executing the command ``pip3 install pandas``
